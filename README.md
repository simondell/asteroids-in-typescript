# Asteroids

I once attended [SebLy's Creative JS course](https://seblee.me/training/) in which we made the basics of an Asteroids clone. I currently have sizable amounts of free time (thanks, Covid-19), so I'm reworking this sketch. I'm now aiming for a playable game with levels, scores and so on.

I also want to improve my TypeScript and TDD skills, and to use some functional programming techniques. I'd long wondered what it would be like to work with a redux-like state management layer driving an animation. 

Eventually I'll host this and change the notes to reflect dev, hosting, etc. I'll move the "developer story" to the wiki, or a blog.
